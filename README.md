# Stock_Prices_prediction
**Predicting the closing prices of S&P_500 stocks using LSTM model** 

The **S&P_500** index is a widely recognized benchmark for the performance of the U.S. stock market, consisting of 500 leading companies from various
industries. The inclusion of companies from diverse sectors allows us to explore and understand the dynamics of the stock market as a whole, providing valuable
insights into market trends and potential investment opportunities.

Here In this project, The aim is to leverage this dataset to develop a predictive model for closing prices of stocks within the S&P 500 index. By analyzing the historical price patterns and incorporating advanced modeling techniques, such as **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models**, I strive to accurately forecast future closing prices for some of the famous companies.
